This site is mostly about my DIY home projects, both in the garden, outside and inside the house.

I've split my other passions into different sites, which can be found here

- Where I write about programming and some of the things I create [https://www.skov.codes](https://www.skov.codes)
- Stories from my rather large passion for running, and some of the trips and races I've run [https://www.skov.run](https://www.skov.run)
- A time registration project I am doing: [https://dev.dotime.me](https://dev.dotime.me)
